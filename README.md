InfixToPostfix
==============
All the Infix Expressions are read from the "Input.txt" file.
Each one of them are converted to the equivalent postfix expression and also Evaluation of expression is done.
Normally a stack is used for conversion from Infix to Postfix but I have used Linked List.

The following Output is saved in "Output.txt" file.
Input expression --- Postfix expression --Evaluation
1 + 2 --â€“ 1 2 + --- 3
